# Go Baby Go Documentation

This repo contains the documentation used to build and customize the small electric cars used by the Go Baby Go project.

## Repo organization

The repo is organized into

* Documentation development information
* Published documentation
* Project files

### Documentation development information

Files and information about writing the documentation are stored in several places:

- Notes on writing and publishing the documentation are found in the repo's wiki
- Issues, bugs, and other transient notes are stored as issues.

### Published Documentation

The source files that produce the published documentation are stored as a Jekyll project under the **docs** folder. These files are automatically built into HTML documentation files that are accessible at (https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo/)[https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo].

### Project Files

Files used by the development and or documentation but are not intended to be published with the end-user documentation are stored in root folders (so long as the folder is not named **docs**)
