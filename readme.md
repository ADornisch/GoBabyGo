## Making a contribution

After you create or modify the files that you want to contribute to the project:

    1. The first place to look is to make sure you do not have any bad metadata in a file.
    1. The next place to look is to make sure you didn't link an image wrong.

The source files that produce the published documentation are stored as a Jekyll project under the **docs** folder. These files are automatically built into HTML documentation files. The master copy of the published documentation is [https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo](https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo/).
