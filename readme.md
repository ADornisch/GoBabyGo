# How to contribute to the Go Baby Go! documentation

Thank you for your interest in the project! We look forward to your contributions!

## Getting ready to contribute

1. Fork the [https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo) repo into your GitHub account.
1. In your forked repo, set the settings to publish the **/docs** folder of the **master** branch. 
    1. You should be able to open the current project from the documentation link shown in the settings tab.
    1. If you DO NOT see the documentation or the link address in the settings, **STOP**  and fix that before you continue.
1. If you see your copy of the documentation in gethub.io, then you're ready to continue.

## Making a contribution

After you create or modify the files that you want to contribute to the project:

1. **Make sure that you can see those changes in your version of the github.io documentation.** This is very important. If you can't see them, then something went wrong and you must fix it before you continue.
    1. The first place to look is to make sure you do not have any bad metadata in a file.
    1. The next place to look is to make sure you didn't link an image wrong.
1. If you see your change in your version of the github.io documentation, continue.
1. Send you pull request to the [https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo](https://github.com/rbwatson/GoBabyGo) repo.
1. If it looks good, it will be merged into this repo and eventually make its way to the published project. If GitHub says that your pull request can be automatically merged, it will be processed more quickly than one that requires conflict resolution.
1. If there's a problem, the pull request will be declined with a comment to help you fix it. After you fix whatever was broken, repeat these steps to resubmit your pull request.
