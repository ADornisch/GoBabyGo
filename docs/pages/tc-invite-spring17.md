# Help make them _Go Baby Go_

Create the documentation that will help student teams build and accommodate Power Wheels cars for children with limited mobility, such as Olivia who was born without arms, but can now drive!

## How you can help
Provide your instructional-design and technical-communication talents to adapt and create the content that students will use to build and adapt the cars for the children. 

To make this happen, we need your help to write procedures and instructions, take photographs and videos of critical tasks, conduct usability testing of the content, and publish the results to the web.

The documentation is starting to take shape at [https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo/](https://merceru-tco.github.io/GoBabyGo/) but it needs your help! Contact [Dr. Bob Watson](mailto:watson_rb@mercer.edu), or just come to the kickoff meeting!

## What’s the reward?

If big smiles like Olivia’s aren’t enough, you’ll use Agile development methods and state-of-the-art tools to publish the content, which will make a great addition to your portfolio and resume. The Mercer University Society of Technical Communication (STC) Student Chapter also sponsors this project so it can help you meet the requirements of the Sigma Tau Chi Honor Society.

## Who is the audience for the documentation?

Mercer Engineering students who are building and modifying Power Wheels cars for specific children.

* These students are often approaching the task for the first time
* They must perform the task within a limited timeframe
* Errors in assembly could cause cost time, money, and in the worst case, cause electric problems
* The sooner a car is built, the sooner another child becomes mobile!

The short-term vision for this project is to make it easy for volunteers to adapt the cars, whether they have an engineering background or not. The long-term vision of the program is to make this project more accessible to a larger audience so that it can be applied by more volunteer groups and accommodate more children.

## What is the schedule?
The next “build event” (where students will build cars for children) is scheduled for March 25-26, 2017. The documentation for the event will need to be complete about one week before the event.
